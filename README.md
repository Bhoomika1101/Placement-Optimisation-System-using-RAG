# Placement-Optimisation-System-using-RAG
The Placement Optimization System is an AI-powered project that enhances campus placements by intelligently matching student profiles with job descriptions. It uses text preprocessing, TF-IDF/BERT embeddings, and vector similarity search to retrieve the most relevant jobs, while a RAG-based language model generates explanations and feedback for recommendations. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, Transformers, Torch, Pandas, and NumPy, this system reduces bias, improves candidateâ€“job fit, and provides smarter, data-driven placement decisions.
